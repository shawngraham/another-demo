In this paper we ask: can machine learning detect visual signals in photographs indicating that the human remains depicted are for sale? Do such signals even exist? This paper describes an experiment in using Tensorflow and the Google Inception-v3 model against a corpus of publicly available photographs collected from Instagram. Previous examination of the associated metadata for these photos detected patterns in the connectivity and rhetoric surrounding this \u2018bone trade\u2019, including several instances where \u2018for sale\u2019 seemed to be implied, though not explicitly stated. The present study looks for signals in the visual rhetoric of the images as detected by the computer and how these signals may intersect with the other data present.</p>"},{"location":"%40grahamFleshingOutBones2018/#annotations","title":"Annotations","text":"<p>%% begin annotations %%</p>"},{"location":"%40grahamFleshingOutBones2018/#imported-on-2023-01-11-941-pm","title":"Imported on 2023-01-11 9:41 pm","text":""},{"location":"%40grahamFleshingOutBones2018/#agree","title":"Agree","text":"<p>[!quote|#5fb236] Highlight The modern online trade in anatomical, ethnographic and archaeological human remains, especially using social media and e-commerce platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, Etsy, Marktplaats, Amazon.com, etc., is becoming documented and exposed (e.g. Huxley &amp; Finnegan 2004; Huffer &amp; Chappell 2014; Halling &amp; Seidemann 2016; Huffer et al. in press).</p> <p>great stuff!</p> <p>Page 1 [[2022-12-13#7:17 pm]]</p>"},{"location":"%40grahamFleshingOutBones2018/#questions-confusion","title":"Questions / confusion","text":"<p>[!quote|#ffd400] Note</p> <p>Page 1 [[2022-12-14#12:39 pm]]</p> <p>[!quote|#ffd400] Highlight Can we teach machines to automatically identify from photographs alone patterns in the \u2018visual rhetoric\u2019 which signal that an item is for sale?</p> <p>Doesn't this have connections with facial recognition technologies that are ehtically suspect?</p> <p>Page 1 [[2022-12-14#12:41 pm]]</p> <p>[!quote|#ffd400] Note</p> <p>Page 1 [[2022-12-14#12:40 pm]]</p>"},{"location":"%40grahamFleshingOutBones2018/#imported-on-2023-01-11-945-pm","title":"Imported on 2023-01-11 9:45 pm","text":""},{"location":"%40grahamFleshingOutBones2018/#agree_1","title":"Agree","text":"<p>[!quote|#5fb236] Highlight Fleshing Out the Bones: Studying the Human Remains Trade with Tensorflow and Inception</p> <p>Page 1 [[2023-01-11#9:45 pm]]</p> <p>[!quote|#5fb236] Note</p> <p>another really great piece of work lads!</p> <p>Page 1 [[2023-01-11#9:45 pm]]</p> <p>%% end annotations %%</p>"},{"location":"extracted%20notes%20from%20%40rubergLivestreamingBedroomPerforming2021-zotero/","title":"extracted notes from @rubergLivestreamingBedroomPerforming2021 zotero","text":"<p>[!info] This note is a bit of a mess.

Building from an understanding of digital space on livestreaming platforms as culturally constructed and fundamentally performative, we ask: What genres of Twitch streams are most often broadcast from the bedroom? What sorts of streamers do or do not include their bedrooms on screen? And how might attending to the bedroom help us bring to light the gendered, embodied, affective, and sexualized character of place on Twitch?

Paying attention to the bedroom prompts us to see how bedroom-like elements appear across many genres of Twitch streams. These common elements may be physical items, like soft plushies that recall pillows or lighting that sets an inviting mood, or they might be affective qualities, like performances of place that offer a sense of closeness with the streamer. The practice of streaming from the bedrooms lays plain the invitation to intimacy and access that is inherent in all livestreaming. After all, the basic fact of streaming implies an intimate invitation: entry, via webcam and direct address, into the private space and thoughts of the streamer. Looking to the bedroom as a site of performance on Twitch reminds us that all livestreaming, wherever it takes place, is an intimate, embodied, gendered, and arguably erotic business that often literally takes place in the home. Put in spatial terms, all streaming is streaming from the bedroom.\" (Ruberg and Lark 2021:691)</p> <p>\"The promise of intimacy and access that comes with streaming from the bedroom, where livestreaming was born, also spills out into other areas of the house.
